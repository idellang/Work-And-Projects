#Titanic

This is my solution to the kaggle titanic project. The first markdown 'Titanic.Rmd' was created after I read ISLR. This file contains mostly EDA of the titanic data with low accuracy of prediction. I tried the titanic exercise again after reading the book applied predictive modeling. The second file was an improvement with usage of preprocessing tools and tuning parameters using caret package
